/*
 * 08A_TIMER_A1_PWM_single: Uses timer A1 to generate PWM on a single pin
 *
 * Using ~1.045MHz SMCLK as TACLK
 *
 * TIMER_PERIOD defines the count before timer resets (1023)
 * Setting DUTY_CYCLE to 768 gives 75% duty cycle  (.75 * 1024 = 768)
 *
 * The total timer period for 1024 cycles is ~980 us  (1/1,045,000 * 1024 * 1000)
 * The output time high for 768 cycles is ~735 us
