/*
 * 07A_TIMER_A0_interrupt: counts up on timer A0 and then interrupts
 * The interrupt then toggles the LED.  Uses LPM3.
 *
 * MCLK defaults to ~1.045 MHz
 * ACLK defaults to ~32768 Hz
 * Timer divides ACLK by 32 so  ~1024 MHZ
 * With TIMER_PERIOD set to 512 an interrupt occurs every 1/2 secs
 *     The frequency is approximately 1 Hz for full cycle
 *
 * Frank Milburn 	25 August 2016
 * Developed on MSP-EXP430F5529 LaunchPad Rev1.5 on CCS V6.1, TIv16.6.0.STS
