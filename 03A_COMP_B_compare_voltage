 * 02A_COMP_B_compare_voltage: demonstrates use of the comparator to determine
 * whether or not the voltage on a pin exceeds ~ 1V.  If exceeded, the red
 * LED is lit.
 *
 * Connect P6.0 to 3.3V and then GND to see the red LED turn on and off.
 * Alternatively a potentiometer can be set up to vary the voltage.
 *
 * BE CAREFUL - DO NOT CONNECT ABOVE 3.6 V
