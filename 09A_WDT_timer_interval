/*
 * 09A_WDT_timer_interval: demonstrates use of the Watch Dog Timer in
 * interval mode (does not trigger a PUC on interrupt) and toggles the red LED.
 *
 * MCLK and SMCLK use default DCO (~1.045 MHz)
 * ACLK uses REFO (~32,768 Hz)
 * WDT uses ACLK as source with clock divider of 32K for toggle every 1 sec
 *
 * Frank Milburn 	3 September 2016
 * Developed on MSP-EXP430F5529 LaunchPad Rev1.5 on CCS V6.1, TIv16.6.0.STS
